- Sidechain to Bitcoin
- Works in-and-out to Bitcoin
- Not mined by Bitcoin but rather federated
- 2 out of 3 members should approve transactions

Not 10 minutes but 1 minute


- So it is not decentralized as Bitcoin
- But it has a purpose - functionality
- Yet you own the asset as in Bitcoin
- You have the risk when you are on the sidechain 

- Differences with Lightning Network
- Lightning 
- is a not-for-profit organization
- is a second layer on top of Bitcoin

- Liquid
- For profit organization
- is another blockchain (side-chain) tied to Blockchain
- Relies on Bitcoin anonymity and censorship resistance
- However fees are going to developers rather than miners (just like Lightning Network)

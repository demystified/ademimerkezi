Sidechain to Bitcoin
Works in-and-out to Bitcoin
Not mined by Bitcoin but rather federated
Only 7 out of 9 to approve transactions

Not 10 minutes but 1 minute


So it is not decentralized as Bitcoin
But it has a purpose - functionality
Yet you own the asset as in Bitcoin
You have the risk when you are on the sidechain
